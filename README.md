# 📰 Tackling Fake News

This project is an AI-powered Fake News Detection System designed to verify whether news is real or fake. It uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning to analyze URLs, text, or images and deliver accurate results. The system is built with a focus on user interaction, feedback, and live information validation.
